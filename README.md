# EFA

This is a simple R implementation of the EFA model with K=2 and no intra-pathway interaction, ie the 'idenfitied' model from Tang et al. The code in simulations.R illustrates how to use the efa function (efa.R), and the resulting plots give a sense of EFA's ability to recover the  latent interacting pathways.
